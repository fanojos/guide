# Bookings

Bookings represent an agreement between a Transportation Service Provider and a passenger. The booking confirms the **vehicle availablility** of a transportation service and the passenger **payment** to reserve access to the vehicle. Bookings are typically represented in the form of a ticket, whether physical or digital, but are distinct from the ticket itself.

## Booking options

When planning a trip, there may be multiple options that would deliver a passenger to their destination. As such, it is important  that the TSP provide access to booking options via a programmatic API.
