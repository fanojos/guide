# Bookings

Bookings represent an agreement between a Transportation Service Provider and a passenger. The booking confirms the **vehicle availablility** of a transportation service and the passenger **payment** to reserve access to the vehicle. Bookings are typically represented in the form of a ticket, whether physical or digital, but are distinct from the ticket itself.
