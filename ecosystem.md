# The MaaS Ecosystem

The world of MaaS comprises a lot of different players and stakeholders. This chapter is to structure the ecosystem of the MaaS world. It is neither complete nor is it covering the whole variety of hybrid types of players. The ecosystem can be described with this picture:

## Infrastructure

At the bottom, you can find the base infrastructure like
* Pavements
* Road/rail networks
* Charging infrastructure
* Stops for public transport
* Parking capabilities

It describes the base on which drivers and vehicles are operating. 

## Drivers and vehicles

On top of the base infrastructure, you can find the moving hardware. There are different kind of vehicles like cars, small and large busses, trams, undergrounds, bicycles. In future scenarios, there may be also autonomous vehicles on the street and drones in the air. Today, there use to be drivers on board of vehicles using some kind of application which may be on-board or on a mobile phone. 

## Transport Service Providers

[Transport Service Providers](introduction.md) (TSP) in this picture are uni-modal transportation offerings. Of course, a public transport provider may own several transport service providers like tram and busses. On this level, there is a full featured service available, including a CRM (Customer Relationship Management), a DRM (Driver Relationship Management), ticketing, billing and clearing capabilities, as well as a routing/dispatching engine. A transport service provider may be interfaced by a Mobility Service Provider (s. below) or directly by an mobile phone app. This level is the first stage to build a community of passengers by rating, commenting and other typical community-building elements.
The TSP not necessarily owns the vehicles or any kind of infrastructure. 

## Mobility Service Providers

A [Mobility Service Providers](mobility-as-a-service-providers/introduction.md) is aggregating several Transport Service Providers to a multi-modal offering. This is done by integrating different TSP offerings technically (e.g. by integrating APIs) or business-wise (e.g. by wrapping a new business model aorund). 
Also this layer can implement the capabilities of a TSP like CRM, DRM, ticketing, etc. 

## Passengers

Passengers are the users of the MaaS offerings. They typically use the services via mobile phone apps or browser apps. Today, TSPs as well as MSPs are providing their own apps. This may lead to a zoo of apps in larger cities and it may happen that a passenger may be able to use a transport mode via several apps.
