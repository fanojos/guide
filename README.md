# MaaS Guide

Guidebook to help Mobility as a Service \(MaaS\) providers.

One of the principle goals of the Mobility as a Service movement is to build a **unified marketplace** of transportation options, so that people can travel freely while experiencing a **simple and consistent user experience**.

It is the **user oriented approach** that distinguishes MaaS from other related concepts, such as multi-modality.
