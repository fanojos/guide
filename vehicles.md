# Vehicles

Vehicles are the foundation of a transportation service, and hence Mobility as a Service. There are many types of vehicles that are managed by a Transportation Service Provider \(TSP\), such as bus, tram, train, taxi, ferry, and rental cars. A TSP may have a fleet of many vehicles of different types, schedules, routes, etc.

Mobility as a Service operators need to know what types of vehicles are available, their locations, and other details in order to extend the TSP service offering to new customer segments.

## Vehicle types

A TSP should make available a list of vehicle types that are part of their fleet. This can consist of standardized classifications for vehicles as well as additional metadata about vehicle characteristics \(e.g. wi-fi onboard, A/C, emissions per kilometer\).
