# Data sharing

Data is the water feeding the growth of Mobility as a Service. It needs to be treated with care, as a common resource providing life to the mobility ecosystem. We may need to work a bit to shed some industrial metaphors that have become entrenched in the way we describe data, so that we can be open to emerging possibilities through a culture of sharing and stewardship.

There are several types of data on which to build a resilient MaaS ecosystem. This chapter will describe a couple of more common data sets and give some insight as to how we can share.

## Origin-destination data

User journies, from a MaaS perspective, typically start somewhere and end somewhere else. These 'somewheres' can be described in terms of space, or place, and time. For example, a person may go from a city center \(origin\) to a recreation area on the outskirts of the city \(destination\) on a Friday evening \(time\).

When we start to collect origin/destination/time data for many journies, a picture starts to emerge, often resembling a 'heartbeat of the city' a flow of people through common corridors. These data and their representative 'pictures' can be used for many purposes, including urban planning or even scheduling an individual trip to avoid congesiton.

## Real-time transportation network data

Increasingly, road vehicles and mobility applications are able to provide data about their movement and surroundings. These data can be used to paint a picture of the current situation across a network. In turn, this picture can be used to optimize the transportation network, reducing bottlenecks and even avoiding accidents.
