Data is the water feeding the growth of Mobility as a Service. It needs to be treated with care, as a common resource providing life to the mobility ecosystem. We may need to work a bit to shed some industrial metaphors that have become entrenched in the way we describe data, so that we can open new possibilities through a culture of sharing and stewardship.
