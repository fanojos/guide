# Roaming

People's lives arent defined by the boundaries of transportation networks. In esssence, people often need to roam in order to fulfill many needs and desires.

Roaming poses unique challenges in the context of transportation. It is not simply sufficient for one provider to plan a network to anticipate demand. Rather, users expect to simply get from where they are to where they want to be without too much hassle or confusion, even when their trip crosses multiple municipalities or regions.

## Avoid creating silos

In the context of roaming, a **silo** is any service that is designed only to operate at the exclusion of other services. A high level goal of Mobility as a Service is to promote interoperability between providers, both at the Transportation Service level as well as the Mobility Service level.
