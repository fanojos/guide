# Roaming

People's lives arent defined by the boundaries of transportation networks. In esssence, people often need to roam in order to fulfill many needs and desires.

Roaming poses unique challenges in the context of transportation. It is not simply sufficient for one provider to plan a network to anticipate demand. Rather, users expect to simply get from where they are to where they want to be without too much hassle or confusion, even when their trip crosses multiple municipalities or regions.
