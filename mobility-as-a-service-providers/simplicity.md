# Simplicity

People have scarce amounts of attention and time. We often juggle multiple goals while managing schedules for work, family, and wellness.

When planning a trip, people should not have to worry about ticket validity, routing, transportation modes, multiple app downloads, or other technical aspects of their journey. Rather, they should be able to focus on where they want to go and what they want to achieve. Mobility as a Service should support people in their daily activities, while staying out of the way as much as possible.
