# Coverage and Routes

Mobility as a Service \(MaaS\) operators need to plan journies on behalf of passengers. In order to help people get where they want to go, it is useful to know what transportation options are available between the passenger origin and destination.

## Coverage

Coverage describes the area and times in which a Transportation Service Provider \(TSP\) operates. The area will typically be in the form of a geographic polygon, indicating the extents of the service area. It is also important to know what times of day people may access the TSP vehicles, as people may travel through a coverage area at all hours.

## Routes

Some TSPs operate vehicles with fixed routes, such as bus or tram lines. It is important to publish route information in common formats, so that MaaS operators can help passengers find routes through a TSP network.
