# Announcements

People and organizations relying on transportation services need relevant service updates. Some types of announcements include service outages, route or schedule changes, and new service offerings.

Service announcements should be provided in human and machine readable formats. The machine readable formats can be displayed to users via MaaS applications or on other information displays.
